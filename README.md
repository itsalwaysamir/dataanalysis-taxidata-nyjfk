# Project Name: Analysis of NYC Taxi Data 

##  Project Intro/Objective 
A taxi company in New York City (NYC) decided wants to optimize the number of cabs waiting at JFK International Airport. The airport is well off the main Manhattan business district. As a result, it takes a very long time for taxis waiting there to be available for other areas. On the other hand, guests arriving at the airport usually cover longer and therefore more lucrative routes. So how many cabs should the cab operator provide at JFK?
